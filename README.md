The telecom industry plays a crucial role in connecting the world. With the advent of 5G, the dynamics of the industry have shifted, offering new opportunities and challenges for telecom providers. As a data analyst, I embarked on an independent project to analyze the market share of Atliqo, one of India’s leading telecom companies, following the launch of their 5G services.

This project was particularly special to me because it marked a transition from guided learning to independent analysis — a step that allowed me to fully apply my skills and creativity in a real-world setting. Having previously completed three guided projects under the excellent tutelage of Hemanand Vadivel and Dhaval Patel, this was my first unguided project, where I took charge of every aspect of the analysis and reporting.
